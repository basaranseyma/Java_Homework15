# Chinese Zodiac Calculator 
This simple Java program is an assignment for [Patika.dev](https://patika.dev) and it calculates your Chinese zodiac sign based on your birth year. It uses the **modulo operator** to determine the zodiac sign by taking the remainder of the birth year divided by 12.

If you enter an invalid birth year, the program will display an error message prompting you to enter a valid birth year.
